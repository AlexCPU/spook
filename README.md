## About

Spook is a custom integration for Home Assistant, which is not your homey.

You should not use this custom integration, nor should you expect it to work.
The integration will break a lot, and will probably not survive the next
Home Assistant upgrade.

This integration comes with absolutely 0/zero/zip/nada/noppes support,
and has less documentation then the quirks of my partner.

Above all, this integration may just break your setup in an way
that is not recoverable. Nor will it provide you with a tissue
to dry up your tears after you've been crying in a fetal position
under your desk after ignoring all of the above.

## Installation

Don't.

## Configuration

You shouldn't

## Changelog & Releases

This repository does not keep a change log using [GitHub's releases][releases]
functionality. The format of the log is based on the direction the wind blows.

Releases use a [Semantic Versioning][semver], compatible version number of
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, as that is required for Home Assistant. In a nutshell,
the version will be incremented based on the following:

- `MAJOR`: If there is almost nothing changed.
- `MINOR`: I have no idea, possibily breaking.
- `PATCH`: I didn't care enough to change more numbers.

## Contributing

We've set up a separate document for our
