# About

Spook is a custom integration for Home Assistant, which is not your homey.

You should not use this custom integration, nor should you expect it to work.
The integration will break a lot, and will probably not survive the next
Home Assistant upgrade. Heck, it will most likely not even survive its own
next release.

This integration comes with absolutely 0/zero/zip/nada/noppes support,
and has less documentation then the quirks of my partner.

Above all, this integration may just break your setup in an way
that is not recoverable. Nor will it provide you with a tissue
to dry up your tears when you are crying in a fetal position
under your desk after ignoring all of the above.

I've warned you :D

# Installation

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=frenck&repository=spook&category=integration)

You could manually add this repository to HACS, but you shouldn't. You can
also install it manually by copying the `spook` folder into your
`custom_components` folder, but you shouldn't. It might be available on the
HACS store at some point (or not) from which you should not install this
integration.

Just don't.

# Configuration

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=spook)

You shouldn't.

# Entities

This integration will provide you with entities you'd absolutely do not need.
All of them are enabled by default to ensure you have a bad time, straight
of the box.

# Services

There are quite a few useless and horrible services available for you to explore
and self-descruct your setup with. The developer service tools are great
to get you into such a situation.

# Entity component services

Spook also extends the services available for entities. These services may
extend the functionality if entity components (like `select`)

# Changelog & Releases

This repository does not keep a change log using [GitHub's releases][releases]
functionality. The format of the log is based on the direction the wind blows.

Releases use a [Semantic Versioning][semver], compatible version number of
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, as that is required for Home Assistant. In a nutshell,
the version will be incremented based on the following:

- `MAJOR`: If there is almost nothing changed.
- `MINOR`: I have no idea, possibily breaking.
- `PATCH`: I didn't care enough to change more numbers.
